Ian and I had a walk on the beach after setting up camp: it had cleared up enough that the waxing gibbous moon cast shadows. It reminded me of the scene in the film 'Contact' where Jodie Foster sees the other as her dad. The sound of the birds here is enchanting. I got up at 6 AM to relieve myself and, whilst particularly indisposed, was visited by a wild turkey. She came within 1 meter of me, and didn't seem too concerned about the size difference between us. She came close enough I felt compelled to poke her with a stick."

The GPS was a problem here and I might have asked for directions, but with a full face helmet sitting atop a 1200cc motor, on roads that seemed to have no easy way to get out of the flow of traffic, it was more difficult. Besides, you know asking for directions violates the man code. After several failures with the navigation system, my son memorized the map and led the way, but in so doing took a wacky turn across two lanes of traffic and I could not follow him. We ended up meeting at the apartment, each finding our own route there. It turns out the Potts Point neighborhood where the BnB is located is kind of like Bellltown in Seattle. Lots of bars and clubs and restaurants. A DJ my son likes, who lives in Colorado, was schedule to perform tonight at a club called Soho, just four blocks away. Kids only have to be 18 to get into clubs here, so lots of kids were there, but the DJ we wanted to hear did not start in time for us to hear him. Back at the apartment now, calling it a day."
